# The Black Spatula Project

# Summary

The Black Spatula Project is an open-source initiative investigating the potential of large language models (LLMs) to identify errors in scientific papers. How many errors can they detect? How serious are those errors? What is the false positive rate, and how much work is it to verify the AI’s work?

The project was inspired by a scientific paper that, due to a simple math error which could have been caught by an AI reviewer, caused many people to toss all of their black plastic kitchen implements.
